<h1>The Zen of Zen Garden</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/"><b>Zen Garden</b></a> is a website dedicated to demonstrating the flexibility of the CSS design. <br />
It allows you to download example files of both the HTML and the CSS or fork the site in Github. In the samples on the website, <br />
the HTML does not change, only the CSS. Zen Garden invites users to practice and play with the CSS file. Users are invited to submit <br />
their designs to Zen Garden. The site requests that the CSS used should be <q>widely-supported elements only</q> and that the user tests <br />
their design across a variety of web browsers. For those users needing more information on how CSS works, the page offers a link to <br />
<q>CSS Resources</q>. Zen Garden is interesting in much the way our last assignment was. The HTML stays the same while the CSS creates an <br />
infinite amount possible designs.</p>

<p> The readings in Duckett focused on layout and overall design of websites in alignment with Zen Garden and its focus on how CSS can <br />
    create interesting and functional websites. </p>
    <ul>
 <li>Positioning schemes such as absolute positioning can be seen in the fixed bottom elements</li>
in the example <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/213/">Under the Sea by Eric Stoltz</a>.
<li>Use of a footer in <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/206/"> A Walk in the Garden by Simon Van Hauwermeiren</a>. </li>
        <li>And the multitude of uses of borders, margins, and padding seen in all of the examples.</li>
    </ul>
    
<p> One of my favorite layouts was <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/218/"> Apothecary by Trent Walton</a>. I liked that there
was an overall muted palette with bright splashes<br /> of color in just a few locations. The bright color of the links made them easy to 
locate. I also liked the historic look of a <br /> broadsheet or medicine label of the overall site and the vintage clipart.
    
</p>
    
<p> In several places, the Apothecary layout takes advantage of the postion:absolute. One of these was after <q>view all designs</q></p>
    <blockquote>.design-archives .previous a, .design-archives .next a { <br />
  position: absolute;<br />
  overflow: hidden;<br />
  width: 2em;<br />
  height: 1.25em;<br />
  color: #3f3d3a;<br />
  text-decoration: none;<br />
  white-space: nowrap;<br />
  text-indent: -9999px; </blockquote>
    
    <p> Additionally, the layout uses 30 instances of :after, which allows things to be inserted after an element. In Apothecary,<br />
    the creator used it for some of the graphics, for example, after the <q>ul</q> list which ends with <q>translations</q>, the CSS includes: </p>
    <blockquote>.zen-resources <b>ul:after</b> {<br />
    margin-top: 3em;<br />
    background: #bad1c2 url('img-halftone.png') repeat;<br />
     -webkit-transform: rotate(45deg) translateY(4.75em) translateX(9em);<br />
       -moz-transform: rotate(45deg) translateY(4.75em) translateX(9em);<br />
        -ms-transform: rotate(45deg) translateY(4.75em) translateX(9em);<br />
         -o-transform: rotate(45deg) translateY(4.75em) translateX(9em);<br />
            transform: rotate(45deg) translateY(4.75em) translateX(9em);<br />
    margin-bottom: -52.5em; </blockquote>
